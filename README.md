## 📑 Sections Overview

### 🎓 Tutorials
Contains all tutorial materials from the course, divided into two essential categories:

- **🏗️ Designing**: 
  This section dives deep into software design principles, including UML diagrams, system architecture, and software planning methodologies. Each tutorial builds on previous concepts, taking you from basic design principles to advanced software architecture patterns. You'll find wireframes, mockups, and detailed design documentation that demonstrate how to plan before coding.

- **💻 Programming**: 
  Hands-on Python coding exercises and implementations that translate design concepts into working code. This section follows a progressive learning approach, starting with fundamentals like data structures and control flow, then advancing to object-oriented programming, file handling, and more complex Python features. Each tutorial includes starter code, requirements, and completed solutions.

Each tutorial folder is self-contained with instructions, resources, code samples, and solution files.

### 📝 ICT Exams
Contains a collection of past exam materials, practice questions, and model solutions. 

This section is particularly valuable for:
- Understanding exam format and question styles
- Practicing under timed conditions
- Reviewing common problem areas
- Building confidence with progressively challenging exercises

Each exam folder includes the question paper, answer schemes, and helpful notes on key concepts tested.

### 📋 Courseworks
Contains detailed coursework assignments and reference solutions organized by contributor:

- **📱 My_Coursework**: 
  My personal coursework submissions, complete with documentation, code, and reflection notes. These showcase my problem-solving approach and implementation style, with comments explaining key decisions and alternative approaches considered.

- **🧩 Saad_Coursework**: 
  Reference materials from Saad, offering alternative perspectives and implementation techniques. These solutions demonstrate different coding styles and problem-solving methods that might be more intuitive for some learners.

- **🔍 Aathif_Coursework**: 
  Reference materials from Aathif, providing yet another approach to the same problems. Particularly strong in optimization techniques and elegant code solutions.

Each coursework folder contains the original assignment brief, implementation files, documentation, and any supporting resources needed to understand the solution.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine
2. **Navigate** to the specific section you're interested in
3. **Read the section README** for detailed information about the contents
4. For tutorials and courseworks, **start with lower-numbered items** as they progressively build on previous concepts
5. **Experiment with the code** - modify, break, and rebuild to deepen your understanding

## 💡 Learning Path Recommendation

For beginners, we recommend this learning sequence:
1. Start with Tutorials/Designing/Tutorial_01 to learn basic design principles
2. Move to Tutorials/Programming/Tutorial_01 to implement what you've designed
3. Alternate between design and programming tutorials as you progress
4. After completing several tutorials, try solving some exam questions
5. Finally, attempt coursework assignments independently before reviewing solutions

## 🐍 Python Environment

This course uses Python 3.x (specifically Python 3.8+). To ensure compatibility:

- Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- We recommend using a virtual environment:
  ```
  python -m venv env
  source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- Install required packages:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
## ⚠️ Important Note

This repository is for educational purposes only. When using reference materials from others:
- Ensure you understand the code and concepts rather than simply copying solutions
- Credit original authors when building upon their work
- Use these materials to supplement your learning, not replace it
